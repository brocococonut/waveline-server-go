# waveline-server-go
The Waveline server written in Golang

Working on rewriting [@Wellenline](https://github.com/Wellenline)/[waveline-server](https://github.com/Wellenline/waveline-server) in Golang to test speed, memory, cpu, and stability improvements.

I intend on making it almost 1:1, or at least have a compatible API with the original.
